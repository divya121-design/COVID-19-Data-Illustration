# COVID-19 Data Illustration Project

The COVID-19 Data Illustration Project is an exploration of the challenges and implications of data dissemination and visualization during the Coronavirus pandemic, particularly focusing on the United States (US). This project aims to highlight the impact of inconsistent data entry practices on data quality and subsequent misinformation dissemination to the general public.

## Abstract

The Coronavirus pandemic emerged as a health crisis of unprecedented magnitude, drawing parallels to historical events like the Spanish Flu. Government-imposed mandates such as quarantines and trade restrictions mirrored the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, commonly known as COVID-19. Amidst this crisis, vast amounts of data were disseminated to the public within the United States.

Early in the pandemic, issues with inconsistent data entry processes led to poor data quality transmitted to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). These data quality challenges cascaded into deficiencies in data visualization and interpretation, ultimately contributing to the spread of misinformation among the general public.

This study delves into the complexities of poor data illustration and proposes methods to enhance the characterization of intended evidence amidst the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
